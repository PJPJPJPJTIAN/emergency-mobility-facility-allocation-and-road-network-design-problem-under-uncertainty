The provided code snippets are associated with the research titled "A two-stage stochastic programming for the integrated emergency mobility facility allocation and road network design problem under uncertainty." In this study, we have developed two precise algorithms tailored to the proposed model. As part of our practical applications, we present code implementations for the algorithm's deterministic equivalent program, specifically designed to address the smaller case study. This manual solvability is intended to assist readers in gaining a deeper understanding of the solution methodologies employed by the algorithm. The accompanying HTML documents allow readers to download and promptly observe the results. Additionally, readers have the option to copy the code snippets and execute them on their Python platforms for further exploration and experimentation.
